# Inventory Management System (Public Use)

- The Public version of my inventory management system web application
    - Available for use @ https://public-ams.netlify.app

- The Private version of this application is located on a VPS and utilizes a backend written with Node & Express
    - The private version is not available for public use as it was written for a specific company and authentication is needed to access it 
    - Because of this, I wanted to create a version open to the public using Local Storage to showcase the UI
